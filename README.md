# Portfolio Website - v1.0

!['r√©sultat'](./mon-portfolio.jpg)

My personal portfolio <a href="https://felipebrando.fr/" target="_blank">felipebrando.fr</a> which displays some of my GitHub projects as well as my resume.
To display my projects I use the GitHub REST API.

This project was built using primarily ReactJs, Redux and Axios.
